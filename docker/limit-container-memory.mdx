## Introduction
When we use `docker`, we often encounter that the `memory` used by the `docker` container is larger than the `memory` of the `docker` host, which will cause the host to crash, resulting in shutdown, which can be prevented by limiting the container `memory`.
## Command Line
Start the `hello-world` container and limit the memory size to `1g`
```bash
docker run -d --name hello-world --memory 1G hello-world
```

## Parameter
| parameter | Introduction                                                               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| run   |Run a command in a new container.|
| -d   |Run container in background and print container ID.|
| --name   |Assign a name to the container.|
